npm init
       npm init is a command-line tool used in Node.js projects to initialize a new package and create a package.json file.
       The package.json file is an essential part of any Node.js project as it contains 
       metadata about the project and its dependencies.
       It includes information such as the 
              project's name, 
              version, 
              description, entry point file, dependencies, and other configuration settings.


npm i nodemon
       `nodemon` is a command-line utility for Node.js development.
        It automatically restarts your Node.js application when file changes are detected. 
        This saves you from manually stopping and 
        restarting the server during development.


npm i express
      Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. 
      It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. 
      With its simplicity and extensive middleware support, Express is widely used 
      for creating scalable and modular server-side applications in Node.js.

-----------------------------------------------
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log("server running on port 5000");
});

npm install body-parser
       body-parser is a middleware for Express.js that allows you to extract the body of incoming HTTP requests. 
       It parses the request body,
       which is often sent as JSON or URL-encoded data, and 
       makes it available in your Express application.

npm install cors
       cors is a middleware for Express.js that allows you to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your application. 
       CORS is a mechanism that restricts cross-origin requests in web browsers for security reasons. 
       The cors package helps you enable CORS in your Express application 
       and define the access rules for cross-origin requests.

------------------------------------------------------
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome');
});

node server.js
